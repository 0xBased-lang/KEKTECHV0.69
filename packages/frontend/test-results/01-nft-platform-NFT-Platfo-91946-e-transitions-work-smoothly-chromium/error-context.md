            - paragraph [ref=e126]: 𝕂Ǝ𝕂TECH emerges from the intersection of art and blockchain technology, born from our appreciation for the PepeCoin legacy dating back to 2016. Our dedicated team initially envisioned a modest NFT collection but found ourselves captivated by the energy of the PepeCoin 🐸 and $BASED 🧠 communities.
            - paragraph [ref=e127]: Our creative journey began in early 2024 within the thriving PepeCoin movement. Through Pepepaint, our team discovered a digital canvas where Pepe art could flourish in new ways. This discovery helped us grow as artists and develop a clear vision for our project.
            - paragraph [ref=e128]: What started as artistic exploration evolved into something meaningful when our early artwork received recognition from Pepelovers 🐸 and other respected figures in the Pepe community. This endorsement fueled our determination to craft more distinctive Pepe art and build something valuable for fellow enthusiasts. With each creation, we deepen our commitment to honoring the culture that brought us together. 🐸🤝
