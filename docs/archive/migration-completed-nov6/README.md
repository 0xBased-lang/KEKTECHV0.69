# MIGRATION COMPLETED - NOVEMBER 6, 2025

## ⚠️ HISTORICAL DOCUMENTATION ONLY

**IMPORTANT**: The migration to the "Minimal Modular" architecture was **COMPLETED** on November 6, 2025 when the system was deployed to BasedAI mainnet.

These documents are preserved for historical reference only. They document the migration process that transformed KEKTECH from its original architecture to the current live system.

## Current Status
- **System**: LIVE ON MAINNET since November 6, 2025
- **Contracts**: Deployed and operational at addresses in `/deployments/basedai-mainnet/contracts.json`
- **Tests**: 100% passing (320/320 tests) as of November 8, 2025
- **Frontend**: Live at https://kektech.vercel.app

## What These Documents Were

These migration documents guided the transformation from:
- **Old Architecture**: 13+ contracts with complex interdependencies
- **New Architecture**: 7 core contracts with clean separation (completed)

The migration was executed in 7 phases:
1. **Phase 0**: Size Verification (completed but skipped consciously)
2. **Phase 1**: Internal Libraries ✅
3. **Phase 2**: Enhanced Metadata ✅
4. **Phase 3**: Versioned Registry ✅
5. **Phase 4**: Factory Unification ✅
6. **Phase 5**: Market Lifecycle ✅
7. **Phase 6**: Dispute Aggregation ✅
8. **Phase 7**: Integration Testing ✅

## Why These Are Archived

- The migration is **COMPLETE**
- The system is **LIVE**
- These documents describe work that has **ALREADY BEEN DONE**
- Referring to them as current guidance would be **MISLEADING**
